# Teaching Kit Experiments

Some experiment into lowering the barrier to webmaker.org/teach kit creation

## Markdown Content
**Idea:** allow users to write the bulk of the content in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)... this is then parsed into html using [showdown.js](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown).

Markdown is typically easier for people to learn than HTML mostly due to its stripped down syntax. The nice thing about this is that markdown is a HTML preprocessor, so it can be used to start introducing some of the concepts of strcutured language that may make life easier moving to HTML and other langauges beyond.
